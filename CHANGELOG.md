## [Unreleased]

## [0.37.0] — 2026-04-13

v0.37 is a performance and coverage release driven by dogfooding `codixing grep` on the Linux kernel. Three big wins: a compact v2 trigram format (~86% smaller on-disk), lazy-loading of concept+reformulation blobs (~2.6 GB of cold-start bitcode decode deferred), and assembly file coverage for kernel/embedded repos. Plus several grep UX fixes surfaced by the same dogfooding run.

### Added
- **Trigram index v2 on-disk format** — `chunk_trigram.bin` gains an `encoding_flags` header and two pluggable codecs: **delta + varint + u32 IDs** (default; Russ Cox codesearch scheme) and **roaring bitmaps** (alternative, production-grade via the `roaring` crate). On a representative test corpus v2 is **86% smaller than v1** (181 KB → 25 KB). Projected Linux kernel impact: 3.0 GB → ~400 MB. Readers dispatch on the version field (v1 still supported for backward compatibility) and use the compact mmap entry layout (16-byte trigram entries with `posting_byte_off` / `posting_count` / `posting_byte_size`). 5 new round-trip tests in `grep_trigram_test.rs`.
- **Lazy-loaded `concept_index` and `reformulations`** — `Engine::open` no longer eagerly deserializes `concepts.bin` (2.1 GB on the kernel) and `reformulations.bin` (528 MB on the kernel) via bitcode. Both are now wrapped in `OnceLock<Option<T>>` and only touched when `search` actually walks the concept-aware or reformulation code paths. `codixing grep` on the kernel no longer pays that ~2.6 GB decode tax on cold start. `Engine::init` pre-seeds the OnceLocks so the freshly built index works without re-reading disk. `reload.rs` just resets the OnceLocks after sync.
- **`Language::Assembly`** — GAS/Intel assembly files (`.S`, `.s`, `.asm`) are now indexed. Line-based label + `.globl` directive extraction, with preceding `#`/`//`/`;` comments captured as doc comments. Local labels (`.L*`, numeric) are skipped to avoid noise. Closes the kernel coverage gap where `codixing grep "schedule_tail"` missed 19 `arch/*/kernel/entry.S` files that `grep -rF` saw. 2 new tests.
- **`AssemblyLanguage` config support** — new `ConfigLanguageSupport` implementation in `crates/core/src/language/assembly.rs`, registered in the language registry alongside YAML/TOML/Dockerfile/Makefile. No tree-sitter grammar, pure line-based entity extraction.

### Changed
- **`codixing grep --count` and `--files-with-matches` ignore the default `--limit`** — previously both modes were clamped by the 50-hit cap, producing e.g. "50 matches across 2 files" when the real total was 390/57. `--limit` is now `Option<usize>`; when unset and `--count` or `--files-with-matches` is passed, the cap is dropped so totals reflect the real match set. Explicit `--limit` is still honoured for backward compat.
- **`codixing grep` now errors clearly on pre-v0.33 indexes** — previously returned `0 matches across 0 files` silently when the index had no `file_chunk_counts` (pre-content-trigram era), giving no hint to the user. Now surfaces `"grep requires an indexed file set but the index is empty — this is likely a pre-v0.33 index built before the content trigram was added. Run codixing init <root> to rebuild."` as an error.
- **`Engine::open` cold start floor cut by ~2.6 GB** — see the lazy-load bullet above. Biggest single win for `codixing grep` on large repos.

### Fixed
- **Silent zero-match on indexes without a content trigram** — see the Changed entry above.
- **`--count` undercounting due to default `--limit`** — see the Changed entry above.

## [0.36.0] — 2026-04-12

v0.36 closes the last grep-fallback gap and collapses the CI→release pipeline so tagging no longer spends ~25 min rebuilding what CI has already cached. 2 PRs: #80 (`codixing grep`), #81 (CI binary reuse). Skipping the v0.35.x patch series — v0.35.0 shipped clean.

### Added
- **`codixing grep` CLI command** — literal or regex text scan across indexed files, trigram-accelerated. Emits `path:line:col:text` by default (1-indexed line/col to match `grep -n`). Supports `--literal`, `-i/--ignore-case`, `--invert`, `--file`, `--glob`, `-C/-B/-A` (symmetric or asymmetric context), `--count`, `--files-with-matches`, `--json`, and `--limit`. Closes the last grep-fallback gap surfaced during v0.35 polish work. Fast-path auto-proxies through a running `codixing-mcp` daemon when available. (#80)
- **`Engine::grep_code_opts(&GrepOptions)`** — structured variant of `Engine::grep_code` that adds case-insensitive matching (via `regex::RegexBuilder`), inverted line selection, and asymmetric before/after context. Legacy positional `Engine::grep_code(...)` remains as a thin forwarder for backward compatibility. (#80)
- **MCP `grep_code` tool gains new params** — `case_insensitive`, `invert`, `before_context`, `after_context`, `count_only`, `files_with_matches`. Existing `context_lines` still accepted as a symmetric shorthand. (#80)
- **11 new tests** — 4 core `grep_trigram_test` cases (case-insensitive literal, case-insensitive regex, invert, asymmetric context) and 7 CLI `grep_cli_test` cases covering every output mode. Total 1087 → 1098. (#80)

### Changed
- **Bash dogfooding hook shrink** — `claude-plugin/hooks/pretool-bash-codixing.sh` drops the single-file, `| wc -l`, and version-string passthroughs (127 → 112 lines). All three cases are now native `codixing grep` features, so the compliance leaks close. Deny message now suggests `codixing grep "<pattern>"` first. (#80)
- **CI now builds release binaries on main + tag pushes** — `ci.yml` gains a `release-build` matrix job (Linux x86_64, macOS aarch64, Windows x86_64 with `--no-default-features`) that stages binaries as `binaries-<suffix>` artifacts with 14-day retention. PRs remain fast (the job is gated on `github.event_name == 'push'`). Separate rust-cache key (`release-<target>`) so release builds and test builds don't thrash each other. `needs: test` so broken code never produces binaries. (#81)
- **`release.yml` simplified to download + publish** — the old build matrix is gone. On `v*` tag push, `release.yml` fetches binaries from the CI run on the same commit via `dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v6` (`workflow: ci.yml`, `commit: github.sha`), then uploads to a GitHub Release and publishes the npm wrapper. Saves ~25 min per release by reusing the CI build cache. Release-mode build breaks on `main` now surface in CI instead of post-tag. (#81)

## [0.34.0] — 2026-04-12

Audit-driven release bundling v0.33 prep and v0.34 follow-ups. 8 PRs: #69, #70, #71, #72, #73, #74, #75, #76. Skipping the v0.33.0 tag — all v0.33 work is included here.

### Added
- **`codixing filter` CLI subcommand** — validate `.codixing/filters.toml` and run the filter pipeline on stdin without booting the MCP server. `check` and `run` actions. (#75)
- **`codixing sync --no-embed`** — escape hatch that temporarily stashes the embedder for the duration of sync, preventing runaway CPU on existing hybrid indexes. Canonical bad case: Linux kernel sync hit 68 min CPU before kill in v0.32. (#75)
- **CLI daemon proxy full coverage** — `symbols`, `usages`, `impact`, `graph --map` now auto-proxy through a running `codixing-mcp` daemon. ~10× speedup on warm daemon, matching v0.33's `search` speedup. (#75, builds on #73)
- **Windows named-pipe client** — the daemon proxy now works on Windows via `std::fs::OpenOptions` on `\\.\pipe\codixing-<hash>`. First time Windows users see the warm-daemon speedup. (#75)
- **Sync progress output** — `codixing sync` now emits `[sync +Xs] <stage>` lines instead of running silent for minutes. (#69)
- **Bash dogfooding hook** — new `PreToolUse` matcher on `Bash` that catches agents shelling out to `grep`/`rg`/`find`/`cat` against indexed files and redirects to the codixing CLI. Closes the biggest bypass in the v0.32 hook. (#69)
- **Plugin ships dogfooding hooks** — `claude-plugin/hooks/` now contains both hook scripts and `plugin.json` registers them, so downstream plugin users get enforcement automatically. (#69)
- **`codixing callers <file>` diagnostics** — distinguishes four cases: file not on disk, file on disk but not in graph (stale index), has callees but no callers (entry point), normal listing. (#74)

### Changed
- **`codixing init` default flipped to BM25+graph-only.** Embeddings are now opt-in via `--embed`. Rationale: embedding a 10K-file repo took 14 min in v0.32, and 63K Linux kernel files took 25 min — unusable defaults. Agent code exploration via `symbols`/`usages`/`callers`/`impact` works fine on BM25+graph alone. (#71) **Breaking for users who expected embedding by default.**
- **`Engine::open` writer-lock retry loop** — retries 10× with exponential backoff (1ms → 512ms, ~1s total) before falling back to read-only mode. Absorbs the intra-process drop-then-reopen race that caused the macOS `git_sync_no_op_when_already_current` flake. Tests no longer need `thread::sleep(100ms)` workarounds between `drop(Engine::init)` and `Engine::open`. (#76)
- **Warning on sync with missing graph** — older indexes predate graph support; sync now warns that graph-dependent features (`impact`, `callers`, `callees`, `graph --map`) will return empty until `codixing init` rebuilds. (#75)

### Removed
- **`codixing-mcp --compact`** — hard-removed. v0.33 accepted+ignored it with a warning; v0.34 rejects it at argument parsing with "unexpected argument". Users with `--compact` in `.mcp.json` must migrate to `--medium` (for clients without dynamic tool discovery) or remove the flag. Closes issue #67. (#70 deprecated, #76 hard-removed)
- **`codixing init --no-embeddings`** — same deprecation cycle as `--compact`. BM25+graph-only is now the default, so the flag has no remaining semantics. (#71 deprecated, #76 hard-removed)

### Fixed
- **Audit reported 0 files on populated graphs** — on large indexes (observed on the Linux kernel), `chunk_meta` hydration could partially fail, leaving `file_chunk_counts` empty while the graph was fully populated. `audit_freshness` now unions `file_chunk_counts.keys()` with `graph.file_paths()` so it never under-reports. Regression test included. (#72)
- **GraphML namespace URI** — was emitting `xmlns="http://graphml.graphstruct.org/graphml"` (a misspelled placeholder). Fixed to the official `http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns` so Gephi/yEd accept the output without schema warnings. Regression test pins the correct URI and asserts the old wrong one is absent. (#69)
- **Tantivy `Access is denied` flakes on Windows** — intermittent failures in `Engine::init` and `TantivyIndex::commit` when Windows Defender scans newly-created segment files. New `crates/core/src/index/windows_retry.rs` helper retries operations up to 10× with exponential backoff on recognized transient error codes (5, 32, 33). Zero-cost on Unix. Covers `create_in_dir_with_config`, `open_in_dir_with_config`, `commit()`, and `IndexReader::reload`. (#74)
- **`claude-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** had duplicate `"version"` keys (technically invalid JSON). Same issue fixed in `npm/package.json` and `docs/install.sh` this release. (#69, #76)
- **Docs drift** — README, CLAUDE.md, docs/index.html now report 1077 tests (was 1019) and 26 CLI commands (was 24/25), add the v0.31.1/v0.32 features that were undocumented on the landing page (GraphML/Cypher/Obsidian exports, git hooks, caller cascade, filter pipeline), and correct the Linux kernel file count from 73K to 63K C/H. (#69)

### Known gaps (v0.35 backlog)
- **Stale codixing index after Edit/Write** — the plugin doesn't yet auto-update the index after file edits, so `codixing symbols` and `codixing usages` can return stale line numbers between syncs. Tracked in issue #77. Workaround: run `codixing sync` or `codixing update` manually after a batch of edits.
- **Daemon proxy for `callers` and `callees`** — the MCP `symbol_callers`/`symbol_callees` tools are symbol-level while CLI works on files. No clean mapping yet; commands stay in-process.
- **`codixing sync` doesn't rebuild a missing graph** — only warns. A true rebuild is effectively a full init and the user should invoke it explicitly.

## [0.31.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Community detection** — Pure-Rust Louvain algorithm on the import graph; `codixing graph --communities` shows natural module clusters with modularity score
- **Shortest path** — `codixing path <from> <to>` finds the shortest import chain between two files via BFS
- **Surprise detection** — Scores edges by unexpectedness (cross-community, PageRank disparity, cross-directory, low confidence); `codixing graph --surprises N`
- **HTML graph export** — `codixing graph --html` generates a self-contained interactive visualization with force-directed layout, community coloring, confidence-styled edges, and surprise highlights
- **Edge confidence** — Every dependency edge tagged `Verified`/`High`/`Medium`/`Low` based on extraction method
- **PreToolUse hook** — Plugin ships a deterministic hook that denies Grep on code/doc/config files and redirects to codixing CLI (replaces the advisory PostToolUse reminder)

### Fixed
- Shortest path BFS excludes `__ext__` pseudo-nodes to prevent false paths through shared external imports
- Legacy graph deserialization derives edge confidence from edge kind instead of defaulting all to Verified
- HTML export escapes `</script>` in embedded JSON to prevent XSS breakout

## [0.21.0] — 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **Refactor:** Split `engine/mod.rs` (2,981 lines) into 4 focused submodules: `init.rs`, `indexing.rs`, `reload.rs`, `validation.rs` — mod.rs now ~1,100 lines
